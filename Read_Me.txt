Final Assignment - My GigBook 1.0

ReadMe 1.0

My GigBook is a sheet music and lyrics storage and management program. All files can be stored on a web server for access across multiple devices, as long as there is an internet connection.

In it's simplest form the user will be able to search for sheet music, lyrics, etc by song title, artist name, style, or tempo. My GigBook runs in a web browser, so all files will be displayed in the browser.

As of right now there are issues connecting to a local database, so the page will only be able to look up lyrics using the musixmatch API. I am still working through the issues accessing the JSON info.

Once a connection to a local database can be resolved the app can be expanded to include user files and other sheet music.

UPDATE 12.10.17:
Lyrics can be successfully searched!!! As of right now I don't believe there is anything which isn't working properly, however additional features would be helpful.

Future features:

*The search should return a list of all available choices of lyrics which will be viewed as links that can be followed for the correct version of the lyrics

*Additional info displayed, such as album artwork, artist release info, etc

*A connection to a local (or online) database for the import, searching, and displaying of the users personal music/lyrics
